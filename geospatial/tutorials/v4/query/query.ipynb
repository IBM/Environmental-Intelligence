Now, ``GeoJSON`` is an open standard format for representing geographic data and their non-spatial attributes.

GeoJSON usually follows the right-hand rule which means that - exterior rings in the definition will be read counterclockwise and interiror rings, clockwise.\n",

    "It is possible to query for predictive temporal ranges (in the case of the Above Ground Biomass dataset) as well as current years. In the case of prediction years the data will be received as <correction needed here as I don't think it's metadata only>; using an AI model for the prediction of values for forecasted AGB data.\n",

    "You can even query for future / prediction years and it need not be only the past years that you're gonna query for. Please note that you won't be able to download/see the tiff file(s) for the prediction years and you'll only get the [metadata](../../v3/query/metadata.ipynb) for those years. The way this works is that, we use previous years' data and by using AI models we'll predict the AGB data for the future years. In the above JSON, except the year 2025, every other year is a historical year. And note that current year will be considered as prediction year in every query."
