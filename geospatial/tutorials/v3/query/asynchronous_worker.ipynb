    "The `query.py` submodule has an asynchronous worker function `ibmpairs.query.batch_query()` that allows for the execution of an array of query objects in a sliding window of an arbitrary number at a time.\n",

    "Given the requirement to run many queries of the raster and 'batch' or 'converted' point types, the use of the asynchronous worker function can speed up the process of `submit()`, `status()` and `download()` as the majority of the time spent in wait is in the checking status.\n",
