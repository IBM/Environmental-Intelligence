<b>List of the Data Sets</b>

Name | | Description
--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------
[PRISM daily US weather](prism_daily_prs/prism_daily_prs.ipynb)| | The data is issued in 3 versions of increasing quality. These are issued on an irregular schedule. Newer, better, data overwrites the previous versions.|
[USGS basic land elevation data](ned_elevation/ned_elevation.ipynb)| | Basic land elevation data from the National Elevation Dataset (NED) of the United States Geological Survey (USGS).|
[Soil properties and soil profile data](soilgrids/soilgrids.ipynb)| | Soil properties and soil profile data is the Data Set that consists of collections of soil property maps for the world produced using machine learning at 250 m resolution. Predictions are made at six standard depths. SoilGrids uses global models that make use of all available input point data to map a property across the globe. This results in consistent predictions (no abrupt changes in predicted values at country boundaries, etc).|
[Monthly seasonal forecasts](twc_seasonal_weather_forecast/twc_seasonal_weather_forecast.ipynb)| | Seasonal forecasts that include maximum, minimum and average temperature, and total precipitation forecasts. Forecasts are produced at monthly intervals from February 1981 to present.|
[CMIP global climate models](global_climate_models_cmip6/global_climate_models_cmip6.ipynb)| | Climate simulations from approximately 100 distinct climate models across 49 modelling groups provide a set of coordinated climate model experiments.|
[GFS 16 day forecast](gfs_hires/gfs_hires.ipynb)| | The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a global numerical weather prediction system containing a global computer model and variational analysis run by the United States National Weather Service (NWS). The mathematical model is run four times a day, and produces forecasts for up to 16 days in advance, but with decreased spatial resolution after 10 days. This Data Set currently contains forecasts from the daily 18:00 UTC run. Moreover, timestamps generally correspond to the valid time of the forecast; that is, the timestamp the forecast is for. All layers in this Data Set have a dimension called "horizon", indicating the difference between the issue and valid time in hours. Thus, one obtains a forecast for 0:00 UTC issued at 18:00 the day before by querying 0:00 with "horizon" 6.|
[GFS latest 16 day forecast](gfs_forecast/gfs_forecast.ipynb)| | Numerical weather prediction system that contains a global computer model and variational analysis from the United States National Weather Service (NWS).|
[Climatologies and validation data](research_2944_climatologies/research_2944_climatologies.ipynb)| | The climatology was calculated by the IBM Future of Climate team from ERA5 data spanning 1991-2020. The methodology similar for that used in the ERA-interim climatology. See the linked references by Jung and Leutbecher as well as Janoušek. That is, a 61 day weighted rolling window with the weights decreasing linearly from their maximum value at the center of the window to zero at +-30 days. This is in contrast to those references (and the ERA-interim climatology), where weights are determined by second-order polynomial.|
[ERA5 Global weather](era5/era5.ipynb)| |As any reanalysis product, ERA5 combines observed data with the output of meteorological models. Note that there are actually two versions of ERA5 data. Initial data is referred to as ERA5T and available in near real time. I.e., ERA5T data lags real time by about three days. About three months later, the final version of the data is released. This is the actual ERA5 data. This Data Set contains both ERA5 and ERA5T data. With the latter being uploaded initially and overwritten once the former is available. As far as currently known, differences between the two versions are negligible. The Data Set contains data for 1980, 1990, 2000, 2005 and from 2009 onwards.|
[Sentinel 2 high resolution imagery](esa_sentinel_2_l2a/esa_sentinel_2_l2a.ipynb)| | Images from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel 2 pair of satellites that view land surface regions.|
[USDA soil properties](us_soil_properties/us_soil_properties.ipynb)| | It contains information about soil as collected by the National Cooperative Soil Survey over the course of a century. It is available for most areas in the United States and the Territories, Commonwealths, and Island Nations served by the USDA-NRCS. The survey data was gathered by walking over the land and observing the soil. Many soil samples were analyzed in laboratories. |
[Current and historical weather](twc_gcod_data/twc_gcod_data.ipynb)| | This dataset provides high-resolution, hourly global weather data at a 4km grid resolution. It includes both current and historical weather data, covering landmasses and coastal waterways. |
[NASA global elevation data](global_elevation/global_elevation.ipynb)| | The datasets result from a collaborative effort by NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. Together, this international space collaboration generated a near-global digital elevation model of the Earth using radar interferometry. The 'targeted landmass' consisted of all land between 60° North and 56° South latitude, which comprises almost exactly 80% of the Earth’s total landmass. The coverage reached somewhat further north than south because the side-looking radar looked toward the north side of the Shuttle. NASA Version 3.0 SRTM (SRTM Plus) data includes topographic data from non-SRTM sources to fill the gaps (“voids”) in earlier versions of SRTM data.|
[Global elevation data](jaxa_global_elevation/jaxa_global_elevation.ipynb)| | This Global elevation data is sourced from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). This is an elevation Data Set that can express undulations of terrain over the world with a spatial resolution of 1 arcsecond (~30m at equator). The data set contains three layers as the actual elevation data, a quality band and a layer indicating any auxiliary data source that has been used to fill missing value. Elevation data that has a vertical accuracy of 5 meters within 1 standard deviation.|
[Spatial grids of fire danger indexes](usfs_wfas/usfs_wfas.ipynb)| |The dead fuel moisture threshold (10–hour, 100–hour, or 1,000–hour), called a time lag, is based upon how long it would take for 2/3 of the dead fuel to respond to atmospheric moisture. The fuel moisture index is a tool that is widely used to understand the fire potential for locations across the country. Fuel moisture is a measure of the amount of water in a fuel (vegetation) available to a fire, and is expressed as a percent of the dry weight of that specific fuel. 10-hour fuel: This refers to vegetation with a diameter of 0.25 to 1 inch. Moisture content for this fuel type can be calculated using weather data at the time of observation, including temperature, humidity, and cloud cover. Alternatively, it can be an observed value from a standard set of fuel sticks, which are weighed as part of fire weather observations.100-hour fuel: This includes vegetation with a diameter between 1 and 3 inches. Its moisture content is typically calculated using the average weather conditions over the past 24 hours, such as day length, rain hours, and the daily range of temperature and humidity.1,000-hour fuel: This refers to vegetation with a diameter between 3 and 8 inches. Moisture content for this fuel type is computed from the average weather conditions over the past 7 days, including factors like day length, rain hours, and the daily range of temperature and humidity.|
[Landsat 8 high resolution imagery](nasa_landsat_8_l1_collection2/nasa_landsat_8_l1_collection2.ipynb)| |This data set provides high resolution imagery from the Landsat 8 satellite from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that includes conditions at the top of the atmosphere.
