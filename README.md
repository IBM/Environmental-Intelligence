## Geospatial Analytics
For documentation and tutorials regarding how to use the ibmpairs SDK for Geospatial Analytics, please consult the [official 
documentation](https://ibm.github.io/ibmpairs/).

Refer to the samples below for various industry use cases of Geospatial Analytics.

Example | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Industry

[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](geospatial_analytics/v3_apis/samples/industry_use_cases/agriculture_ndvi/normalized_difference_vegetation_index_analysis.ipynb) | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to quantify vegetation greenness and is useful in understanding vegetation density and assessing changes in plant health.                                                                                                        | Agriculture
[Water and Moisture Detection](geospatial_analytics/v3_apis/samples/industry_use_cases/agriculture_water_and_moisture_detection/water_and_moisture_detection.ipynb) | Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) provides a relative indication of the wetness or dryness of an area, helping to identify potential water stress or drought conditions or combustibility levels in fire-prone areas. | Agriculture, Disaster Events
[Sea Rise Risk Prediction](geospatial_analytics/v3_apis/samples/industry_use_cases/climate_change_tidal_surge/sea_rise_risk_prediction.ipynb) | Geospatial Analytics can help determine the possible regions that come under the threat of rise in sea levels                                                                                                                                                                          | Climate Change, Disaster Events

## Geospatial Analytics Above Ground Biomass (AGB)

To know the basics of Geospatial Analytics Above Ground Biomass (AGB) Dataset, start with the [AGB Catalogue](geospatial_analytics/v4_apis/samples/quickstart/agb_catalogue/agb_catalogue.ipynb) sample.
